\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
%This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Tutorial document.
%Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
%Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.

%In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
%Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
%Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.

% Begin Abstract Here
Like temperature and pressure, solution pH is an important environmental variable in biomolecular simulations. 
Virtually all proteins depend on pH to maintain their structure and function. 
In conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins, pH is implicitly accounted for by assigning and fixing protonation states of titratable sidechains. This is a significant drawback, 
as the assigned protonation states may be wrong and they may change during dynamics.
In this tutorial, we guide the reader in learning and using the various continuous constant pH MD methods in Amber and CHARMM packages, which have been applied to predict {\pka} values and elucidate proton-coupled conformational dynamics of a variety of proteins including enzymes and membrane transporters.
\end{abstract}

%Here you would explain what problem you are tackling and briefly motivate your work.


%Keep in mind, as you prepare your manuscript, that you should plan for a representative image  which will be used to highlight your article on the journal website and publications. Usually, this would be one of your figures, but it must also be uploaded separately upon article submission. We give specific guidelines for this image on the journal website in the section on article submission (see \url{https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/index.html#article-submission}).

%Additionally, for well-formatted manuscripts, we recommend that you let LaTeX handle figure/table placement for you as much as possible, so please avoid specifying strenuous float instructions like `[h!]` and `[H]` as much as possible.

\section{Author Contributions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This section mustt describe the actual contributions of
% author. Since this is an electronic-only journal, there is
% no length limit when you describe the authors' contributions,
% so we recommend describing what they actually did rather than
% simply categorizing them in a small number of
% predefined roles as might be done in other journals.

% See the policies ``Policies on Authorship'' section of https://livecoms.github.io
% for more information on deciding on authorship and author order.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Henderson, Liu, Harris, Huang, de Oliveira, and Shen
together wrote the manuscript.
We thank Zhi Yue and Paween Mahinthichaichan for contributing example scripts for the hybrid-solvent CpHMD simulations of transmembrane proteins.
We thank Jason A. Wallace for a bash script to calculate {\pka} values and track the convergence of unprotonated fractions using Grace.
