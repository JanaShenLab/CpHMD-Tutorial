  abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and
              analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such
              as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any
              number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and
              coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more
              ``representations,'' in which each representation embodies a
              particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected
              subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are
              chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes
              Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a
              complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as
              a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for
              complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and
              function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces
              a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster
              images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input
              scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering
              applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the
              ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
              trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct
              connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization
              component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem
              solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel
              MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the
              visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++,
              using an object-oriented design; the program, including source
              code and extensive documentation, is freely available via
              anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  abstract  = "Amber is the collective name for a suite of programs that allow
               users to carry out molecular dynamics simulations, particularly
               on biomolecules. None of the individual programs carries this
               name, but the various parts work reasonably well together, and
               provide a powerful framework for many common calculations. The
               term Amber is also used to refer to the empirical force fields
               that are implemented here. It should be recognized, however,
               that the code and force field are separate: several other
               computer packages have implemented the Amber force fields, and
               other force fields can be implemented with the Amber programs.
               Further, the force fields are in the public domain, whereas the
               codes are distributed under a license agreement.The Amber
               software suite is divided into two parts: AmberTools21, a
               collection of freely available programs mostly under the GPL
               license, and Amber20, which is centered around the pmemd
               simulation program, and which continues to be licensed as
               before, under a more restrictive license. Amber20 represents a
               significant change from the most recent previous version,
               Amber18. (We have moved to numbering Amber releases by the last
               two digits of the calendar year, so there are no odd-numbered
               versions.) Please see https://ambermd.org for an overview of the
               most important changes.AmberTools is a set of programs for
               biomolecular simulation and analysis. They are designed to work
               well with each other, and with the ``regular'' Amber suite of
               programs. You can perform many simulation tasks with AmberTools,
               and you can do more extensive simulations with the combination
               of AmberTools and Amber itself. Most components of AmberTools
               are released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). A few

              simulations of very large biological objects on CPU- and
              GPU-based architectures. NAMD offers scalable performance on
              petascale parallel supercomputers consisting of hundreds of
              thousands of cores, as well as on inexpensive commodity clusters
              commonly found in academic environments. It is written in C++ and
              leans on Charm++ parallel objects for optimal performance on
              low-latency architectures. NAMD is a versatile, multipurpose code
              that gathers state-of-the-art algorithms to carry out simulations
              in apt thermodynamic ensembles, using the widely popular CHARMM,
              AMBER, OPLS, and GROMOS biomolecular force fields. Here, we
              review the main features of NAMD that allow both equilibrium and
              enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with numerical
              efficiency. We describe the underlying concepts utilized by NAMD
              and their implementation, most notably for handling long-range
              electrostatics; controlling the temperature, pressure, and pH;
              applying external potentials on tailored grids; leveraging
              massively parallel resources in multiple-copy simulations; and
              hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical descriptions. We
              detail the variety of options offered by NAMD for
              enhanced-sampling simulations aimed at determining free-energy
              differences of either alchemical or geometrical transformations
              and outline their applicability to specific problems. Last, we

              efforts toward achieving optimal performance on GPU-based
              architectures, for pushing back the limitations that have
              prevented biologically realistic billion-atom objects to be

		  Alzheimer's disease, functions within a narrow pH range.
		  Despite tremendous effort and progress in the development
		  of BACE1 inhibitors, details of the underlying pH-dependent
		  regulatory mechanism remain unclear. Here we elucidate the
		  pH-dependent conformational mechanism that regulates BACE1
		  activity using continuous constant-pH molecular dynamics
		  (MD). The simulations reveal that BACE1 mainly occupies
		  three conformational states and that the relative
		  populations of the states shift according to pH. At
		  intermediate pH, when the catalytic dyad is monoprotonated,
		  a binding-competent state is highly populated, while at low
		  and high pH a Tyr-inhibited state is dominant. Our data
		  provide strong evidence supporting conformational selection
		  as a major mechanism for substrate and peptide-inhibitor
		  binding. These new insights, while consistent with
		  experiment, greatly extend the knowledge of BACE1 and have
		  implications for further optimization of inhibitors and
		  understanding potential side effects of targeting BACE1.
		  Finally, the work highlights the importance of properly

  abstract	= {Discovery of targeted covalent inhibitors directed at
		  nucleophilic cysteines is attracting enormous interest. The
		  front pocket (FP) N-cap cysteine has been the most popular
		  site of covalent modification in kinases. Curiously, a
		  long-standing hypothesis associates the N-cap position with
		  cysteine hyper-reactivity; however, traditional
		  computational methods suggest that the FP N-cap cysteines
		  in all human kinases are predominantly unreactive at
		  physiological pH. Here we applied a newly developed
		  GPU-accelerated continuous constant pH molecular dynamics
		  (CpHMD) tool to test the N-cap hypothesis and elucidate the
		  cysteine reactivities. Simulations showed that the N-cap
		  cysteines in BTK/BMX/TEC/ITK/TXK, JAK3, and MKK7 sample the
		  reactive thiolate form to varying degrees at physiological
		  pH; however, those in BLK and EGFR/ERBB2/ERBB4 which
		  contain an Asp at the N-cap+3 position adopt the unreactive
		  thiol form. The latter argues in favor of the base-assisted
		  thiol-Michael addition mechanisms as suggested by the
		  quantum mechanical calculations and experimental
		  structure-function studies of EGFR inhibitors. Analysis
		  revealed that the reactive N-cap cysteines are stabilized
		  by hydrogen bond as well as electrostatic interactions, and
		  in their absence a N-cap cysteine is unreactive due to
		  desolvation. To test a corollary of the N-cap hypothesis,
		  we also examined the reactivities of the FP N-cap+2
		  cysteines in JNK1/JNK2/JNK3 and CASK. Additionally, our
		  simulations predicted the reactive cysteine and lysine
		  locations in all 15 kinases. Our findings offer a
		  systematic understanding of cysteine reactivities in
		  kinases and demonstrate the predictive power and physical
		  insights CpHMD can provide to guide the rational design of
		  targeted covalent inhibitors.},

		  molecular dynamics simulations to gain atomically detailed
		  insights into the three salient features of this
		  experimental system: (1) a pHresponsive switch between the
		  crystalline network junctions formed by intermolecular
		  hydrogen bonding between chitosan chains and electrostatic
		  cross-links based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles;
		  (2) viscoelastic behavior of the SDScrosslinked network;
		  and (3) a stable but erasable gradient between the two
		  cross-linked regions. Our simulations showed that the
		  electrostatic cross-links are formed through the
		  pH-dependent salt-bridge interactions between the chitosan
		  glucosamines and SDS sulfates. Interestingly, the strength
		  and directionality of the salt-bridge interactions give
		  rise to complementary shape changes, despite the intrinsic
		  stiffness of the chitosan chain or the hydrophobic forces
		  that keep the micelle intact. Additionally, the salt-bridge
		  contacts display temporal and spatial dynamics, which
		  offers a microscopic explanation of the viscoelastic
		  properties of the SDS-crosslinked network. Another
		  significant finding is the pKa difference between the
		  chitosan crystallite and the SDS-bound chitosan chain,
		  which provides a physical origin for the persistent but
		  erasable gradient in the structural and mechanical

		  behaviors by altering the structure and function of

		  findings also show that, by blocking pHi increases, cancer
		  cell behaviors can be attenuated. This suggests ion

		  that BACE1 activity is dependent on the dynamics of a

		  conditions of constant pH. In constant-pH simulations,
		  preidentified ionizable sites are allowed to spontaneously
		  protonate and deprotonate as a function of time in response
		  to the environment and the imposed pH. The method, based on
		  a hybrid scheme originally proposed by H. A. Stern (J.
		  Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 164112), consists of carrying out
		  short nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (neMD) switching
		  trajectories to generate physically plausible
		  configurations with changed protonation states that are
		  subsequently accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis
		  Monte Carlo (MC) criterion. To ensure microscopic detailed
		  balance arising from such nonequilibrium switches, the
		  atomic momenta are altered according to the symmetric
		  two-ends momentum reversal prescription. To achieve higher
		  efficiency, the original neMD-MC scheme is separated into
		  two steps, reducing the need for generating a large number
		  of unproductive and costly nonequilibrium trajectories. In
		  the first step, the protonation state of a site is randomly
		  attributed via a Metropolis MC process on the basis of an
		  intrinsic pKa; an attempted nonequilibrium switch is
		  generated only if this change in protonation state is
		  accepted. This hybrid two-step inherent pKa neMD-MC
		  simulation method is tested with single amino acids in
		  solution (Asp, Glu, and His) and then applied to turkey
		  ovomucoid third domain and hen egg-white lysozyme. Because
		  of the simple linear increase in the computational cost
		  relative to the number of titratable sites, the present
		  method is naturally able to treat extremely large

  abstract	= {Generalized Born (GB) models provide, for many
		  applications, an accurate and computationally facile
		  estimate of the electrostatic contribution to aqueous
		  solvation. The GB models involve two main types of
		  approximations relative to the Poisson equation (PE) theory
		  on which they are based. First, the self-energy
		  contributions of individual atoms are estimated and
		  expressed as ``effective Born radii.'' Next, the atom-pair
		  contributions are estimated by an analytical function f GB
		  that depends upon the effective Born radii and interatomic
		  distance of the atom pairs. Here, the relative impacts of
		  these approximations are investigated by calculating
		  ``perfect'' effective Born radii from PE theory, and
		  enquiring as to how well the atom-pairwise energy terms
		  from a GB model using these perfect radii in the standard f
		  GB function duplicate the equivalent terms from PE theory.
		  In tests on several biological macromolecules, the use of
		  these perfect radii greatly increases the accuracy of the
		  atom-pair terms; that is, the standard form of f GB
		  performs quite well. The remaining small error has a
		  systematic and a random component. The latter cannot be
		  removed without significantly increasing the complexity of
		  the GB model, but an alternative choice of f GB can reduce
		  the systematic part. A molecular dynamics simulation using
		  a perfect-radii GB model compares favorably with
		  simulations using conventional GB, even though the radii
		  remain fixed in the former. These results quantify, for the
		  GB field, the importance of getting the effective Born
		  radii right; indeed, with perfect radii, the GB model gives
		  a very good approximation to the underlying PE theory for a
		  variety of biomacromolecular types and conformations.},

		  effects is a key element in the theoretical and

		  solvent models, particularly generalized Born (GB)
		  continuum electrostatics, have emerged as an attractive
		  tool to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules in

		  methodology, there remain limitations in the

		  work, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a
		  balanced implicit solvent force field by further optimizing
		  the input atomic radii in combination with adjusting the
		  protein backbone torsional energetics. This parameter
		  optimization is guided by the potentials of mean force
		  (PMFs) between amino acid polar groups, calculated from
		  explicit solvent free energy simulations, and by
		  conformational equilibria of short peptides, obtained from
		  extensive folding and unfolding replica exchange molecular
		  dynamics (REX-MD) simulations. Through the application of
		  this protocol, the delicate balance between the competing
		  solvation forces and intramolecular forces appears to be
		  better captured, and correct conformational equilibria for
		  a range of both helical and {$\beta$}-hairpin peptides are
		  obtained. The same optimized force field also successfully
		  folds both beta-hairpin trpzip2 and miniprotein Trp-Cage,
